# Max Klein's public repo of example code

Most of the files in this repo are notebooks filled with code created in the course of coming up with answers to questions on Stack Overflow (username: [tel](https://stackoverflow.com/users/425458/tel)).

You can launch and run the code in any of the notebooks right now, in an online environment provided by binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/telamonian/public_tests.git/master

Various other examples, notes, and tests are also present here. Most of this miscellany was generated as tangents in the course of coming with SO answers.
